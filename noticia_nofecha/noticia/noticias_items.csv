http://www.blackseagrain.net/novosti/phl-eyes-end-2018-ok-of-rice-tariff-law,PHL eyes end-2018 OK of rice tariff law,,,"AMID pressure from trade partners, Manila informed the World Trade Organization (WTO) that it is “hopeful” of passing the legislation that would convert its quantitative restriction (QR) on rice into tariffs before the year ends.



A trade official privy to the matter told the BusinessMirror the Philippines informed members of the WTO at last week’s Committee on Agriculture (COA) meeting that it is facing “unavoidable” delays in passing its rice-tariffication law.



The delay, according to the trade official, who was not authorized to speak for the Philippines, was caused by “other pressing priority legislation initiatives of the President” and “limited resources in Legislative and Executive branches of the government.”



“It reassured WTO members it will continue to work on it within its resource limit and hopefully update the information within the year,” said the trade official, who is based in Geneva where the WTO is also headquartered. “The Philippines said hopefully the tariffication legislation can be adopted within this year.”



The source said Canberra sought for an update on Manila’s efforts in converting its rice QR into tariffs during the COA meeting on June 11 and 12. The Australian representative to the COA meeting said Manila’s rice tariffication “is an issue being raised for quite some time.”



The delegation of the European Union (EU) echoed the concerns of Canberra and asked the Philippines to hasten its rice tariffication process and abide with its commitment “finally and for good.”



“The EU said it hopes it can be done as soon as possible because it is very important,” the trade official said.



In a February COA meeting, the Philippines vowed to present its rice tariff law by June; however, the contrasting Legislative priorities of both chambers of Congress delayed its passage.



The National Economic and Development Authority (Neda) earlier told the BusinessMirror it is targeting to pass the country’s rice-tariffication law and present it to WTO member-countries by October.



“By October, if we still cannot report any substantial progress on the action we have taken, then it will be difficult for us. Our trading partners might ask for further concessions. Worse, we might be sanctioned, but that’s the worst-case scenario,” Neda Undersecretary Rosemarie G. Edillon said in an interview last month.



The substitute bill that would amend Republic Act (RA) 8178, or the Agricultural Tariffication Act, which imposed the QR on rice, has already passed concerned House of Representatives Committee levels and is now awaiting plenary deliberations.



The House of Representatives earlier eyed to pass the bill in March but faced delays due to other Legislative priorities of the lower chamber.



At the Senate, the Committee on Agriculture and Food is yet to issue its consolidated draft bill amending RA 8178 and converting the rice QR into tariffs.



Sen. Cynthia A. Villar, chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Food, said she is taking her time in crafting a “better” rice-tariffication law to ensure that farmers would not be at a disadvantage by the influx of cheap foreign rice.



“We know what our problems are. We have thught about it and we are thinking [about] how to pass a better law,” Villar told reporters in an interview at PICC on May 31.



“Give us time. Because we are thinking of the solutions to the problems that [lifting of rice QR] will cause. We are studying it very hard,” Villar added.



Villar is eyeing an end-2018 passage of the bill in the Senate. She earlier vowed to pass it by March as it was a Legislative priority of the Duterte administration.



Edillon noted how “crucial” it is for substantial progress to be made by the Philippines on amending RA 8178. Trading partners, such as Australia, Thailand and the United States, have recently raised questions regarding the country’s efforts to scrap the rice QR.



These countries may ask for more concessions if the Philippines fails to make substantial progress on converting the rice QR into tariff. Australia and the US may seek expanded market access for their livestock products, while Thailand may request for a higher minimum access volume for its rice.



Last month Agriculture Undersecretary Segfredo R. Serrano called on the Senate and the House of Representatives to prioritize the passage of the rice-tariffication bill so that the Philippines could immediately comply with its commitment to the WTO.



“What we are saying is that the rice-tariffication [bill] should be passed as soon as possible. Let’s not mingle it with other issues, such as the reorganization of the NFA [National Food Authority],” Serrano told reporters in an interview at the House of Representatives in Quezon City on May 21.



“Everyone has agreed that we must tariffy, but that doesn’t mean we have to dissolve the NFA. That’s a different issue,” he added.

According to a report on GMA's ""24 Oras Weekend"" on Sunday, some 100,000 sacks from Vietnam arrived in the port of Tabaco in Albay. The shipments will be discharged on Monday, and will be distributed to the Bicol region.



Another batch arrived in the port of General Santos, which has been temporarily stored in an NFA warehouse in the area. The supply will be distributed to commercial areas in Sarangani and in General Santos.



The Philippines last month ordered an additional supply of 250,000 metric tons (MT) of rice to increase the stock in the country: 130,000 MT from Vietnam, and the remaining balance of 120,000 MT from Thailand.



The NFA earlier said the additional imports would arrive in the Philippines by the end of May, and would effectively stabilize rice prices by June.



The state grains agency last week, however, said the delivery was stalled due to enhanced rains brought about by Typhoon Domeng.

“We are working on increasing the reserves due to the rise in consumption in light of the presence of a large number of Syrian refugees,” the official told The Jordan Times, noting that, since the onset of the Syrian crisis, Jordan’s monthly wheat consumption has risen from 50,000 to 80,000 tonnes.



On Thursday, Jordan floated a tender to buy 120,000 metric tonnes of wheat, with the deadline for receiving bids running through June 27,according to the official.



“Our reserve is excellent and we have shipments en route to the Kingdom,” the official, who preferred to remain anonymous, said.



Currently, wheat reserves stand at 888,000 metric tonnes, which is enough for 11.1 months.



Wheat consumption also witnessed an increase during Ramadan, due to a higher demand on various types of bread, the official said, stressing: “We have plans for several other tenders during the upcoming period in light of the demand.""

The official said more tenders will be offered soon to buy barley as Eid Al Adha is approaching.



On Thursday, Jordan floated a tender to buy 120,000 tonnes of barley with bids accepted until June 26.



The barley reserve stands at over 562,000 tonnes, which is sufficient for more than nine months, the official said. Jordan consumes around 55,000 tonnes of barley per month.

http://www.blackseagrain.net/novosti/what-makes-some-varieties-of-rice-resistant-to-drought,What makes some varieties of rice resistant to drought?,,,"In thirty years, the global population of 7 billion will increase by 30% to a staggering 9.1 billion people. Feeding everyone with the same amount of land that is available today will undoubtedly be a challenge. Along with expanding cities gobbling up agricultural and forest land, changing climatic conditions with frequent spells of droughts also spell doom for food production. Hence, researchers around the world are developing drought-resistant varieties of food grains. In one such attempt, researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, offer critical insights into the intrinsic nature of certain types of rice that can resist drought.



Rice, a water-intensive crop grown by humans for thousands of years, is a staple in many countries and the Asian rice, Oryza sativa, is the most widely cultivated rice of the genus Oryza. The crop fails during a drought, and water scarcity affects more than 23 million hectares of rainfed rice production areas in South and Southeast Asia. While some varieties have the potential for drought adaptations, the researchers of the study are exploring the mechanism behind this through phenomics—the study of interactions of genes with changes in the environment.



“India has 34.5% of total irrigated area, which indicates that the rest of the farming area depends mostly on rain. Even after constructing 91 major reservoirs, only 162 billion cubic meters of water can be stored. Recently in India, eleven states out of twenty-nine were affected by drought, resulting in a 40% yield loss, amounting to $800 million. Therefore, our work aims at exploring the traits that can be used in selecting drought-resistant crop”, says Prof. Archana Chugh, from IIT Delhi and an author of the study published in the journal Plant Physiology and Biochemistry. The study was supported by the National Agricultural Science Fund (NASF) under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR).



The researchers of the study investigated three varieties of rice; Sahabhagidhan—a local drought-tolerant variety, and two drought-sensitive varieties: IR64 and MTU-1010. The researchers simulated the drought condition by cutting off water supply to these plants for five consecutive days. They then explored the genetic factors that help these varieties tolerate drought and correlated them with the plant’s response to the applied stress with the aim of developing a reliable 'marker' for drought resistance, which indicates the plant's ability to survive periods of extreme water scarcity.



“A successful marker can be helpful in selection of drought-tolerant varieties at different levels like morphological, anatomical, biochemical, physiological and molecular. They should be easily detectable and stable. Secondary traits such as root attributes, xylem diameter, stomatal aperture, proline, and malondialdehyde can be used as selection criteria by plant breeders for high yield production and drought tolerance in rice”, explains Prof. Chugh in an interview with Research Matters.



But, what exactly happens to a plant during a drought? Lack of adequate water limits its growth and affects its morphology, physiology, and biochemistry. Leaves reduce in size, the stem and roots elongate, there is a reduction in photosynthesis, transpiration and biomass, and an imbalance in nutrients. The roots are the first to experience stress due to drought as they grow beneath the soil. Hence, to survive, they either become more dense, holding the soil together and maintaining the water potential or grow deeper to access more water.



The authors found that Sahabhagidhan, the drought-tolerant variety, continued to grow its roots during the stress, while the drought sensitive varieties showed a reduction in the rate of growth. Also, they observed that in Sahabhagidhan, the xylem vessel, which carries water in plants, had reduced its area and its numbers to survive the stress. This modification maintains water supply by avoiding the formation of air bubbles, known as cavitation.



The study also found a significant correlation between the morphological traits in these roots and the expression of aquaporin genes. Aquaporins are proteins that form pores in cell membranes. They regulate water uptake along with other small molecules. The researchers investigated two aquaporins, OsPIP2;5 and OsNIP2;1, and found that the drought tolerant variety showed an increase in OsPIP2;5, which may be useful to increase the intake of water and thus supply to aerial organs. A decrease of OsNIP2;1 in the same plant indicates another method of drought avoidance—decreasing the membrane permeability to avoid excess water loss.



Correspondingly, the drought sensitive variety showed a significantly lower content of proline—an amino acid used to synthesise proteins, than the drought-resistant variety. The researchers believe this is because the proline proteins assist in maintaining the stiffness of cell membrane during water deficient periods, enabling the cell to carry on functioning. As a result of drought, plants produce malondialdehyde (MDA), a known marker of oxidative damage, a condition wherein due to chemical imbalances, the plant is unable to detoxify itself of damaging elements. Oxidative damage can eventually lead to cell death. A 1.5 fold reduction in MDA content in Sahabhagidhan, as compared to the drought sensitive variety, implies the former’s superior resistance to drought.



“Improvement of drought tolerance in rice is a challenging task due to the high complexity of the traits and poor understanding of plant response against drought. Wide knowledge of various attributes can achieve yield stability under most devastating drought stress. Our study contributes more towards selectively breeding from the thousands of cultivars available,” says Dr. Chugh when probed about the potential for findings of the study. Marker-assisted selection (MAS), discussed in this research, can help feed the millions by intelligently selecting plants with desired traits.

Rice exports up by 30pc to $1.58b in 10 months,,,"Pakistan has come out of the crisis of low exports, which was observed during the last three years, as the rice exports have increased by around 30 percent to $1.58 billion during the first 10 months of the current fiscal year (2017-18) as exporters pushed fresh cargoes to Indonesia, Kenya and other markets.



Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan chairman Samee Ullah Ch said that value of rice export trade has been showing improvement due to the coordination of REAP members with the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan and customs. “Our members are putting in untiring efforts, and aggressive marketing to increase rice exports and to earn valuable foreign exchange,” he added. He said rice exporters are making investments to install modern rice processing machinery and using value-addition technology.



He said the association is sending trade delegations to various countries for rice marketing. “Last month our delegation came back after a successful visit to Iran, which is very lucrative and a potential market for basmati rice. Around 100,000 tons of rice has so far been exported to Iran during the current season.” He hoped that a handsome amount of foreign exchange would be fetched by Pakistani rice exporters. He said that rice exports amounted to $1.23 billion during the corresponding period last year.



Samee Ullah Ch said exports increased 15 percent to 3.23 million tons during the 10 months of the current fiscal year of 2017/18. He said exports of non-basmati rice to Indonesia increased during the period.



“We exported 50,000 tons of non-basmati rice to Indonesia during the July-April period. Kenya remained the largest buyer of Pakistani non-basmati rice, buying 323,000 tons of rice amounting to $118 million. China is also one of the largest importers of Pakistani non-basmati rice.” He said demand for rice in the international markets is increasing. The crop was good in terms of both quality and quantity this year, he added.

Pork exports this year may rise 6.4 percent, more than forecast in May, and the 2019 gain will be 2.9 percent, the USDA said Tuesday in a monthly report. The agency cited “continued strong shipments to a number of key markets and expectations of continued pork exports to Mexico” in 2018.



Last week, Mexico imposed tariffs on some U.S. meat cuts and cheese in a response to American import taxes on steel and aluminum. “Continued strength” in U.S. shipments of fatty dairy products this year may counter the Mexican move, the USDA said.



After Mexico announced tariffs, the National Pork Producers Council said the U.S. industry is “taking on water fast” amid trade disputes, and the U.S. Dairy Export Council said the levies may “delivery a blow” to exports.



The USDA’s outlook was also positive for grain. The agency boosted the forecast for sorghum exports on demand in China, which recently scrapped an import tariff. Wheat shipments may climb as crops shrink in rival nations, and burgeoning corn demand abroad probably will cut domestic inventory, according to the report.

Pulse flours are popular in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific and used in snacks, batters, baked foods and high-moisture applications such as yogurt and pudding to meet clean label requirements.



Pulse flours’ rising demand has resulted in a growth in research on its nutritional benefits, use and available varieties. Future Market Insights (FMI) put together a study, “Pulse Flour Market: Global Industry Analysis 2012-2016 & Opportunity Assessment 2017 – 2026,” of its global market, which is estimated to reach about $28.8 million in revenue by the end of 2026. The study also expects pulse flour to increase at a CAGR of 10.7% between 2017 and 2026.



Leading the way in the list of pulse flours is chickpea. The FMI predicts that it will emerge as the top-selling pulse flour and bring in an estimated $10.3 billion in revenue. Chickpea flour is high in protein and carbohydrates and is used in a variety of dishes, especially in India.



Pulse flour will find its largest application in bakery and confectionery foods. The category is expected to reach approximately $11.4 billion in revenue by the end of 2026, driven by consumer demand for gluten-free products and bakeries targeting health-oriented consumers with pulse flour’s nutritional content.



Pulse flour distribution is set to lead with food chain services. And, according to the study, Asia Pacific excluding Japan will remain dominant in the market, bringing in about $14.2 billion in revenue. North American and Europe also will experience a rise in demand.



The FMI’s list of major players in the global market for pulse flours include: CanMar Grain Products, Parakh Agro Industries Ltd, Bean Growers Australia, Best Cooking Pulses, Great Western Grain, Blue Ribbon, Diefenbaker Spice & Pulse, Batory Foods, EHL Limited, Anchor Ingredients, SunOpta, The Scoular Company, ADM, and Ingredion.

http://www.blackseagrain.net/novosti/philippines-unlikely-to-be-rice-self-sufficient-duterte,Philippines unlikely to be rice self-sufficient: Duterte,,,"The Philippines is unlikely to become self-sufficient in rice production, President Rodrigo Duterte said on Wednesday, appearing to contradict his agriculture minister who had set a 2020 target to produce enough rice to meet the country's needs.



The Southeast Asian country is a frequent buyer of rice mainly from Vietnam and Thailand, usually importing more than one million tonnes of the staple grain every year to meet domestic demand and maintain stockpiles.



Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Piñol said last year the country could produce enough rice for its own needs by 2020 with the help of free irrigation and other state measures to boost output.



""I do not believe we can be rice sufficient,"" Duterte said in a speech to officials of state universities at the presidential palace.



""If you'd ask me, in the next how many years, we will just have to import rice,"" Duterte said.



He said shrinking farmland and a growing population made it difficult to produce enough rice to meet domestic needs.



In April, Duterte ordered the National Food Authority (NFA) to build up its depleted rice stockpiles to the equivalent of 60 days of national consumption, or about 1.92 million tonnes.



The NFA has so far bought 500,000 tonnes mostly from Vietnam and Thailand and is set to import an additional volume of up to 805,200 tonnes.



Duterte said on Wednesday he wants NFA warehouses to be filled ""up to the ceiling"" with rice.



""I do not care if we have to sell it at a lower price someday if there's a glut in the market,"" he said.



Retail rice prices in the Philippines have risen steadily since the start of the year due to the absence of government-subsidized supply in the market. This has fed inflation which hit its highest level in at least five years in May.

http://www.blackseagrain.net/novosti/mexican-sorghum-buyers-to-visit-u-s,Mexican sorghum buyers to visit U.S.,,,"A team of Mexican grain importers and feed millers from the National Association of Food Manufacturers for Animal Consumption (ANFACA) will visit the United States June 18-22 to tour major sorghum growing areas, develop new relationships as well as continue to strengthen existing relationships with U.S. suppliers.



The group of buyers selected by the U.S. Grains Council represents companies from central and northern Mexico, including the state of Jalisco, the No. 1 livestock producing state in the country, Michoacán and Sonora. Mexico is the fourth largest producer of livestock feed worldwide accounting for 33.87 million tonnes. Of this total, Jalisco, Sonora and Michoacán contribute to a combined 31% of overall production.



“For years, Mexico has been a valued trading partner with the United States, and the ties between U.S. sorghum farmers and Mexican importers has only grown, due in large part to the importance of the North American Free Trade Agreement,” said Tom Sleight, president and chief executive officer of the U.S. Grains Council. “This team visit is another example of why maintaining an open line of communication is important. Mexican buyers have the opportunity to see the full U.S. sorghum value chain — from crops in the field to elevators and port facilities — and trips like these encourage continued direct sales between the two countries.”



The tour will include visits to sorghum suppliers and producers, feed mills, elevators, a rail facility, an ethanol plant and the Port of Houston. The team’s visit will focus on U.S. sorghum production, marketing and export logistics in Texas and Kansas.



“This trade mission is a great reflection of how organizations like USGC, the Sorghum Checkoff and other state organizations, such as Texas Grain Sorghum Producers and Kansas Grain Sorghum Commission, work together to build and maintain market opportunities for U.S. producers,” said Florentino Lopez, executive director of the Sorghum Checkoff. “These buyers will leave with a better understanding of U.S. sorghum quality and production, helping build future sales to Mexico and increasing buyer trust.”



Mexico accounted for $103 million in exports of U.S. sorghum, equating to 568,254 tonnes (22.4 million bushels), during the 2016-17 marketing year. Mexico remains one of the chief importers of U.S. sorghum, second only to China in purchases.

http://www.blackseagrain.net/novosti/frances-lavish-wheat-fields-fuel-expectations-of-large-harvest,France's Lavish Wheat Fields Fuel Expectations of Large Harvest,,,"Farmers across France are calling the upcoming harvest one of the best they’ve seen in years.



The wheat fields from Dijon to Reims are bright green, standing tall and getting ready to be harvested starting from next month. After a cold and long winter, the weather in France took a turn for the better. It got warmer, rainier and yield prospects are improving, farmers and cooperatives say.



The country will probably produce 37 million to 38 million metric tons of wheat this year, according to estimates from InVivo, a union of grain cooperatives. If it reaches 38 million tons, that would be the third-highest year in data from the French Agriculture Ministry going back to 1993.



""It could be a good crop in terms of quantity, much better than last year, much better than the last two,” Christoph Bueren, the chairman of Vivescia, one of France’s top grain cooperatives, said in an interview in Reims.



The good growing conditions in France are a contrast to Russia, U.S., Australia and Canada, where dry weather left fields parched. Benchmark wheat futures have rallied 22 percent this year on concern that global stockpiles will fall for the first time in six years.



Read: Dry Fields Leave Wheat Futures Poised for ‘Explosive’ Gains



The weather now is good for crop development, with intervals of rain and sun, according to Francois Farges, the deputy director at Cerevia, a union of grain cooperatives. It’s warmer, but not excessively hot, and temperatures are around the 25 degrees Celsius (77 Fahrenheit), which is optimal, Vivescia’s Bueren said.



French wheat is currently at the filling stage, meaning that each day that temperatures exceed 25 degrees Celsius will lead to a drop in yield equivalent to 150 kilograms per hectare, according to crop researcher Arvalis.



There are still some risks. Conditions were favorable for fungal diseases including fusarium, which can hurt yields and produce chemicals known as mycotoxins that are poisonous for humans or livestock.



Cerevia says it’s keeping an eye on the situation, but hasn’t spotted any serious diseases in the Burgundy region, where it operates. Fusarium was found in some crops near Reims, said Frederic Terzieff of Promo-Vert, which studies crop diseases for companies that make products including pesticides and fertilizers.



Better crop yields mean the protein content will probably return to normal levels of 11 to 11.5 percent, according to InVivo. Last year, French wheat had protein of 12 percent to 12.5 percent, allowing exporters to sell to markets such as Saudi Arabia for the first time ever.



“In all probabilities, if the yields stay good, we will have lower protein levels than last year,” Philippe Kerbidi, a trader at InVivo, said last week.



""When you look at the fields, even if you are not an agronomist like me, it’s green, it’s regular, it’s nice,"" Kerbidi added. ""The crop size is more than decent.""

He said the country produced 73 per cent of local rice and the rest was imported, based on a long-term contract.



“However, to ensure Malaysia’s food security remains intact, the government is conducting a holistic study relating to the country’s padi and rice management



“In making the best preparations, the government will get the view of the National Agriculture Advisory Council as well as other stakeholders.



“A thorough study is necessary because imported rice must be managed well so that there is no disruption in the country’s rice supply,” he said in a statement today.



Shamsuddin was commenting on recent news reports about Malaysia’s rice supply.



He said new planning and direction to manage the industry would also focus on several matters including stockpile management; subsidy and incentive management, quality and padi farmers welfare.

If realized, ending corn stocks at 1.577 billion bushels would be the lowest level since the 2013-14 marketing year, USDA said.



USDA domestic corn stocks estimates, for both marketing years, were below analysts' expectations, sources said.



""This month's 2018/19 US corn outlook is for reduced beginning stocks, lower feed and residual use, greater corn used for ethanol production, and lower ending stocks,"" USDA said. ""Beginning stocks are down largely reflecting a 75 million-bushel increase in projected exports for 2017/18 to 2.300 billion bushels, which if realized would be the highest since 2007/08.""



The estimates of US corn to be used for ethanol production in the 2018-19 marketing year was at 5.675 billion bushels, from 5.575 billion bushels in the previous marketing year.



The projection of US corn to be exported in the 2018-19 marketing year was at 2.100 billion bushels, from 2.300 billion bushels in the previous marketing year. The estimates of US corn to be exported in the 2017-18 marketing year was 75 million bushels higher from last month's report.



""Exports during the month of April were record high, besting the prior monthly shipment record set in November 1989,"" the USDA added. ""Export inspection data for the month of May implies continued robust global demand for US corn, while old crop outstanding sales at this point in the marketing year are record high."" The projection for the 2018-19 marketing year foresees 35% of the next season's corn supply going towards production of ethanol and byproducts, while 13% would be exported, the data showed.



The USDA estimated the global corn ending stocks at 154.69 million mt, down 4.46 million from its May estimate and 38 million mt lower than its 2017-18 estimates of 192.69 million mt.



USDA world corn stocks estimates, for both marketing years, were within the lower range of analysts' expectations, sources said.



""Major global trade changes for 2018/19 include lower forecast corn exports for Russia, with reductions in corn imports for Vietnam, Iran, and Algeria,"" the USDA said. ""Foreign corn ending stocks are lowered from last month, mostly reflecting reductions for the EU, Brazil, and Vietnam that more than offset increases for Ukraine and South Africa.""



USDA is projecting a 10-cent rise in its US midpoint season-average farm price for the 2018-2019 marketing year to $3.90/bushel, the agency said.



Corn is the primary feedstock for ethanol production in the US and is the main competitor for dried distillers grains.

Compared to the previous year, output for the world’s fourth largest wheat producer is forecast to rise by 3%, while planted area is projected to fall by 2%, according to the June quarterly report from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Science (ABARES).



“Total planted area to winter crops is forecast to decrease by 4% to 21.2 million hectares as a result of forecast declines in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia,” ABARES said. “Favorable prices of cereal feed grains relative to prices of oilseeds and pulses and drier-than-average seasonal conditions are expected to result in a significant increase in area planted to barley and a (decrease) in area planted to canola, chickpeas and lentils.”



ABARES said barley production is forecast to increase by 3% year on year to 9.2 million tonnes and canola output is projected to fall 16% to 3.1 million tonnes.



“Barley production is forecast to increase more modestly than might be expected given the forecast increase in planted area because barley yields in Western Australia are forecast to fall from above average back to average,” ABARES said.



Among other crops, chickpeas production is forecast to decline by 40% to 616,000 tonnes and oats production is forecast to remain unchanged at 1.1 million tonnes.



In May, Australia’s biggest listed bulk grain handler, GrainCorp Ltd., reported a 64% decline in half-year profits compared to a year ago in part because of dry weather that has reduced grain production in eastern Australia.

According to official data from Brazil, exports to Argentina reached 109,000 mt last month, taking the total to nearly a quarter of a million tonnes so far this year.



It imported 209,000 mt in the past seven years from its neighbour.



Argentina, the world’s third largest producer and exporter of soybeans and the largest exporter of soymeal and soyoil, has suffered a dry summer that has baked its crop and slashed soybean production by almost 40% to about 35 million mt.



In order to keep crushers running and meet contractual commitments to sell soymeal and soyoil, Argentina’s crushers have bought almost 500,000 mt from the US.



But while that is for delivery in the next crop year, starting in September, crushers had been seeking more immediate purchases from Brazil.



However, a trucker strike that crippled the country’s transportation network put a halt to those discussions.



“We were getting offers regularly up until the strike, but nothing much has happened since then,” said one market source in Buenos Aires, adding he expected talks to restart.



The USDA said last month that it expected Argentina's imports of soybeans to reach 4 million mt this crop year, double the previous year’s volume.



Argentina typically imports soybeans from Paraguay to press in its vast crushing industry.

http://www.blackseagrain.net/novosti/france-seeks-freeze-on-palm-oil-use-imports,"France seeks freeze on palm oil use, imports",,,"France wants to cap and progressively cut palm oil imports and will propose to do so at a European level, a junior minister said on Monday, as farmers block refineries across the country in protest against use of the vegetable oil in biofuels.



""We will commit at EU level to cap, to freeze ... based on the total 2017 volumes, the volume of imported (palm) oil to reduce it gradually in the coming years,"" French junior ecology minister Sebastien Lecornu said on Europe 1 radio.



The move is aimed at reducing the use of palm oil blamed for causing deforestation in southeast Asia, he said.



French farmers were blocking access to oil depots and at least three refineries using tonnes of onions, wood and rubble on Monday as part of a three-day protest over plans to allow Total <TOTF.PA> to use palm oil at a biofuel plant.



Brune is in Luxembourg where European energy ministers are meeting to discuss the bloc's energy and climate goals.



It would then revise that cap depending on the conditions of forests and develop a strategy to fight deforestation, she wrote, without giving further details.



Hulot had said last year France would take steps to restrict the use of palm oil in producing biofuels in order to reduce deforestation in the countries of origin, without detailing the measures.



Small farmers in Malaysia, the world's second largest palm oil producer after Indonesia, said a move to cap palm oil exports at an EU level would be discriminatory and a ""betrayal"".



""This proposal is a betrayal of promises made by the French Government, and others in Europe, to the people of Malaysia,"" they said in a statement sent by Faces of Palm Oil lobby group.



""Those promises must be honoured. Attempts to camouflage this discrimination behind technical calculations are deceitful.""



French Defence Minister Florence Parly said in comments reported in the Malaysian press in January that Malaysia could ""rely on France"" for support against the proposed ban.

http://www.blackseagrain.net/novosti/cbot-wheat-prices-strengthened-due-to-precipitation-deficit-in-the-main-producing-regions-3,CBOT wheat prices strengthened due to precipitation deficit in the main producing regions,,,"WHEAT. During May 31 - June 07, CBOT wheat prices strengthened slightly (+0.1%). The US wheat export spot prices (SRW) for July delivery remained at the previous week’s level, while French wheat supply prices kept growing (+USD 3/MT).

Futures strengthened on information about precipitation deficit in the Black Sea countries, Argentina and Australia. Excessive rains were seen in the EU countries, with the exception of Poland, Spain and Portugal, reports UkrAgroConsult.

Against the backdrop of soil drought in the US winter wheat producing regions, its conditions kept worsening. As of June 03, the share of plants in good and excellent conditions was 37%, compared to 38% a week before (49% on the same date last year). At the same time, the start of winter wheat harvesting limited the price growth.

The weather factor supported French wheat prices. Wheat exports from the EU countries remained low.

CORN. Over the period under review (May 31 - June 07), CBOT corn prices lost 4.52%. The US corn export prices decreased by USD 10/MT (July delivery), while Argentinean corn supply prices fell by USD 8/MT, reports UkrAgroConsult.

Sowing of spring crops in the USA is almost complete. By July 03, corn sowing had been carried out on 97% of the intended area (+5% over the week). Over the week, the share of plants in good and excellent conditions decreased from 79% to 77%. However, this is higher than last year's 68%.

Market operators estimate the future US corn crop at a high level, which remained the main bearish driver for corn futures.

Brazilian farmers began to harvest the second corn crop. By this date last year, farmers had gathered corn from 3% of the intended area. Devaluation of Brazilian real still triggers the growth of farm sales in the domestic market.
